Blogly is a simple blogging app where multiple users can:
- create an account
- attach a URL to their picture
- create, edit and delete blog entries
- create, edit and delete customized tags they can attache to their blog posts
- view blogs by user, topic or most recent

It was written as a school assignment from scratch using Python, Flask, Jinja, Postgres, and SQLAlchemy with a little bit of bootstrap.

To run it you will need to check the requirements text, clone a copy and must be in the flask-blogly subfolder.

Options for future development include:
- Sign-in/sign-out capacity
- Adding security (using WTForms)
- Integration into another platofrm including e-mail or RSS updates of new posts
- SEO optimization for posts/making them into files rather than just SQL data
